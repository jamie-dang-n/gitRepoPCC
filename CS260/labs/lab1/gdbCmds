How to view the call stack/examine individual stack frames: The call stack is where we find the stack frames that control program flow. When a function is called, it creates a stack frame that tells the computer how to return control to its caller after it has finished executing. 

To get a backtrace, write "backtrace". A backtrace is a list of stack frames below the current frame. The frames will be numbered.

With the numbers from backtrace, you can write "frame <number>" to change stack frames. To examine stack frames, use "info frame" to see information about the current stack frame.
"info locals" will display the list of local variables and their values for the current stack frame.
"info args" will display the list of arguments."
